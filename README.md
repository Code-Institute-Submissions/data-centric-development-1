# Milestone Project - Data Centric Development (DCD)

Welcome to Derek Dhammaloka's Milestone Project on Data Centric Development (DCD).
My idea is holiday manager.  It has the ability to create (add), read (get), update (edit) and
delete holidays as well as categories.

## UX

As a user, I want to be able to create, read, update and delete holiday.
I want to find out a holiday that fits my needs (e.g. in terms of categories).
I want to delete a holiday that does not fit my needs (e.g. in terms of categories).
I want to modify the description of my holiday (e.g. the hotel is closed for refurbishment
and an alternative hotel is provided).
I want to add a holiday as soon as it becomes available.

Features include Create (Add), Read (Get), Update (Edit) and Delete Holidays and Categories.

Fields include Category Name, Holiday Name, Holiday Description, Nights and Depart Date.

Wireframes are available in the wireframes folder.
Schema is available in the dbdiagram folder.
