# Milestone Project - Data Centric Development (DCD)

Welcome to Derek Dhammaloka's Milestone Project on Data Centric Development (DCD).

## UX

As a user, I want to have a be able to create, read, delete view of the holiday.
I want to delete a holiday that does not fit my needs (e.g. in terms of categories).
I want to modify the description of my holiday (e.g. the hotel is closed for refurbishment
and an alternative hotel is provided).
